%% For a linearized model determine the input u(t) that brings the pendulum
% from initial angle 5â—¦ and zero initial angular velocity to the origin in 0.5
% and 1 second with minimum energy and plot x1(t), x2(t) and u(t) as the
% functions of t as Matlab figures (i.e. 3 figures each with 2 courses, do not
% forget units).

% u(t)        [N]       the torque applied to the pendulum [N]
% x1(t)       [rad]     deviation of the pendulum from the lower position
% x2(t)       [rad/s]   angular velocity
